## FAQ

#### Why only in C language?    

Because C does't provide any boilerplate or class to implement data structure in one line as we can do in mordern languages like c++, java, javaScript etc.

#### need of Get Code?

When we try to solve any of the data structure problem in C, We have to write multiple time same code again and again for different problem it kills our time, So by using Get Code we can save our time and focus our ataintion to the problem.
